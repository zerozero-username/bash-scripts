# bash-scripts

A repository I created to store all the bash scripts I've done. May get bigger with time!

* **net-fix :** Something I did due a problem I would sometimes get when using windscribe and the internet wouldn't work properly due to the program. So I did this little fix and it works fine!

* **update :** If you're like me and just want to update everything and be done, this can help a lot.
Obs: This use apt so you may need change a bit if your distro is not debian based.
